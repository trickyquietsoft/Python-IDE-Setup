# Python-IDE-Setup
Python IDE Setup is a fully automated Python IDE and environment installation program.

Once the program is complete you'll have all the tools you need to create your own python projects, like neural networks.
I'm working on making the IDE simpler to use until then you'll have to launch the IDE manually.

Step 1:Activate the environment

To activate a Python virtual environment on Windows, follow these steps:

a. Open a Command Prompt or PowerShell terminal.
b. Run the activation command:

   ```
   spyder-env\Scripts\activate
   ```

   

c. After running the activation command, you should see the virtual environment name in the terminal prompt like this:

   ```
   (spyder-env) C:\path\to\the\environment>
   ```

   This indicates that the virtual environment is active, and any Python commands you run or packages you install will be isolated within the virtual environment. Useful for adding new         package specific features to your project.

**Note:Deactivating the Virtual Environment**

To deactivate the virtual environment and return to the system-wide Python installation, simply run:

```
deactivate
```

After deactivation, the terminal prompt will no longer show the virtual environment name, indicating that you are back in the system-wide Python environment.

Step 2:Launch Spyder

a.Just type "spyder" into the prompt and to the IDE
